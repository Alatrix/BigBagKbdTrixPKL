Source code info
----------------

The info about DreymaR's Big Bag of keyboard trickery is mainly found on the Colemak forum:

* The [Big Bag main topic][CmkBBT] with better explanations and links.
* Daughter topics for implementations, including the [Big Bag for PKL/Windows][CmkPKL] one.


Compiling
---------

* For standard non-Unicode PKL versions, get the Ahk2Exe compiler v1.0 from the [AHK download page][AHKDld].
* Choose the right PKL_Source\PKL_#.ahk file, eD or orig.
* Choose to compile into your main PKL folder.
* You may choose any name for the .exe and run it afterwards.
* Choose PKL_Source\Resources\Main.ico as the custom icon file.

Setup:
------

1. Just compile right into your main PKL folder, or move the resulting .exe file there.
2. For PKL_eD, adjust any extra settings in the DreymaR_layout.ini file in your layout folder.
3. There's a sample DreymaR_layout.ini file in the Colemak-eD_ISO_CurlAWide-Sl layout folder.
  
  
_Best of luck!_
