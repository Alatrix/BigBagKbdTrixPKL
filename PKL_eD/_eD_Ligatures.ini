; This file provides named string sequences callable by layouts with the &<li> syntax
; It usually goes in the ./PKL_eD folder and is used by PKL_eD.exe

;;  - SendInput is not fast for long strings. Meanwhile, released modifiers get stuck!
;;  - To prevent stuck modifiers, ligatures can be sent by the SendMessage method.
;;  - For multiline strings, Message performed about twice as fast as Input for me.
;;  - For short strings SendMessage may be slower than SendInput, but it's robust.
;;  - The Paste method pastes the string via the clipboard. May not be reliable in all apps.
;;  - Paste seems best for block sending (n or rn): Fast, if the app gets line breaks right.
;;  - Message sending with +Enter line parsing works in most contexts but it's slower.
;;  
;;  Ligature syntax:
;;  - Multiline strings are used as illustrated below
;;  	- The string entry is set to <li> = <Multiline> ##, where ## is the number of lines
;;  	- There should also be ## (00-99) numbered lines named <li>-##
;;  	- End-of-line comments (<whitespace>;<comment>) are not stripped for these lines
;;  - Use optionally quoted strings to preserve white space
;;  - Use [\r \n \t \b \\] escapes for [`r `n `t `b \]
;;  - \n is line break, but some apps require \r\n. Can set the line break mode w/ brkMode.
;;  - There may be a system limit of about 5000 characters per string? I haven't tested.

;;  Line break mode: Send as `n, send as `r`n, or split lines and send Shift+Enter between.
brkMode = +Enter		; +Enter, n, rn
;;  String send mode: SendMessage calls, Clipboard Paste or SendInput {Raw}.
strMode = Message		; Message, Paste, Input
