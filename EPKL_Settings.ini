;;  EPKL Layout settings:
;;  - Choose a layout that fits your board (ISO/ANSI) and ergo mod preferences. Tip: CurlAngleWide is great! ^_^
;;  - The main layout file is "Layouts\<LayoutFolder>\layout.ini"; <LayoutFolder> can be any subpath of Layouts\.
;;  - You can use multiple layouts and give them human-readable names like this:
;;      layout = LayoutFolder1:DisplayedName1,LayoutFolder2:DisplayedName2
;;  - Remove ';' before 'layout = ' on one line only in the [pkl] section and comment out the current - or make your own!
;;  - Define layouts directly by folder name(s), or use the "universal" shorthand form below (if available)
;
;;  "Universal" [eD] layout setup notation for EPKL, configurable for ANSI/ISO keyboards and ergonomic mods
;;    * To use the KbdType, Curl/ErgoMod and Locale shorthand, refer to them as @K/@C/@E/@L resp.; see below.
;;    * My main layout types are:
;;      - [eD] with full Shift/AltGr mappings, and
;;      - VK or 'VirtualKey' which only moves keys around (Shift/AltGr are kept as in the OS layout)
;;  =====================================================================================================================
;
;;  * KbdType (@K) values: ANS/ISO (JIS is not implemented yet, sorry!)
;;  * CurlMod (@C) values: Curl (Colemak-DH), or -- (none). Usable for Cmk/Tmk layouts with Angle(-Wide/Wing) mods.
;;  * ErgoMod (@E) values: --, Angle, AWide, AWing (AWing is ANSI only) ergonomic mods.
;;  * LocalID (@L) values: --, Locale code (usually two-letter ISO ALPHA-2 country codes like XKB uses)
;;      - Premade locales (mostly CurlAWide): BaHrRsSi, BeCaFr, BrPt, Cz, De, DkNo, EsLat, FiSe, It, Nl, Pl, Ru/Bg...
;;  * The [@L]@V shorthand translates to [@L]@K@C@E, which again produces [-<LocalID>]_<KbdType>[_<CurlMod><ErgoMod>]
;;  
;;  Examples: CurlMod/ErgoMod = --/-- gives no ergo mods; Curl/AWide gives Colemak-CAW.
KbdType = ISO		; ANS (for ANSI), ISO
CurlMod = Curl		; --, Curl (usually requires one of the 'A' ergo mods)
ErgoMod = Awide		; --, Angle, AWide, AWing
LocalID = --		; --, Locale code (-- defaults to US-type layouts). Check in the layout folders which ones exist, or make your own.

;;  Tarmak learning steps: Gradually switch from VirtualKey QWERTY to Colemak
;;  - The Tarmak steps are: Tarmak0(QWERTY), Tarmak1(E), Tarmak2(ET), Tarmak3(ETR), Tarmak4(ETRO) and Tarmak5(Colemak)
;;  - Tarmak layouts only have two ergo mods for now: CurlAngle and CurlAWing (ANSI). For plain Tarmak, use mods = --.
;layout = Tarmak\Tm1-VK@V:Tarmak1@C,Tarmak\Tm2-VK@V:Tarmak2@C,Tarmak\Tm3-VK@V:Tarmak3@C,Tarmak\Tm4-VK@V:Tarmak4@C,Tarmak\Tm5-VK@V:Colemak(VK)@C
;layout = Tarmak\Tm1-VK@V:Tarmak1@C,Tarmak\Tm0-VK@K@E:QWERTY(VK)@E

;;  DEMO/DEBUG: Cycle through the ergo mods (for ANS or ISO). Comment out the line with a ';' to use the definition below instead.
;layout = Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD@L@K_CurlAWide:Cmk[eD]@L-CurlAWide,Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD@L@K_AWide:Cmk[eD]@L-AWide,Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD@L@K_CurlAngle:Cmk[eD]@L-CurlAngle,Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD@L@K_Angle:Cmk[eD]@L-Angle,Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD@L@K:Cmk[eD]@L@K
;layout = _Import\CmkCAWeD_WIP

;;  Colemak[edition DreymaR]; switch to VirtualKey or [eD] QWERTY with the same ergo mods except Curl
layout = Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD@L@V:Colemak[eD]@L@C@E,QWERTY\QWE-VK@K@E:QWERTY(VirtualKey)@E
;layout = QWERTY\QWE-eD@K@E:QWERTY[eD]@E,Colemak-eD\Cmk-eD@L@V:Colemak[eD]@L@C@E

;;  Start with plain VirtualKey QWERTY; switch to VirtualKey Colemak with ergo mods

;;  NOTE: AdvancedMode affects the number of menu entries. Hotkey full names may change depending on the settings.
;trayMenuDefault = 6& 			; pos 	- The nth menu entry including separator lines, by default Change layout
trayMenuDefault = Change Layout (Ctrl+Shift+2) 	;   	- Names must match fully, including the hotkey part

extendMods      = RAlt,RShift 	;   	- Mod1,Mod2

;;  If your system layout has deadkeys, put them here.
;;  For instance, in some locales '^' is a dead key so to actually type '^' you hit '^' then Space.
;;  If you write "auto", PKL will use the correct mode only if it's in the tables.
systemsDeadkeys = auto 			;   	- The keys of your OS layout (such as ¨´^`~), or auto to use the tables

;;  Compact mode: The layout file is in the same folder as EPKL.exe
compactMode     = no

;;  If you often forget to exit PKL at a shared computer, you can set a suspend timeout in minutes.
;;  After this time of inactivity (no keypresses) PKL will suspend itself.
;;  The exit timeout is similar: after this time is spent suspended PKL will shut down.
;;  For example if you use suspend=5, exit=30, then after 5 minutes of inactivity PKL suspends.
;;  If you forgot to disable PKL and left, five minutes later your friend would never know.
;;  After 30 minutes in suspension, PKL would then exit.
;;  You can disable these features by setting the timeouts to 0.
;;  NOTE: only coming out from suspension counts as an activity for exitTimeOut, 
;;        so if you write 0/30 to suspend/exit, PKL will exit after 30 minutes 
;;        even if you type or press other keys.
;;  If startSuspended is yes/true/1, EPKL will start up suspended. But it's probably better to just start it when needed?
suspendTimeOut  = 0 			; min 	- Idle time before PKL is suspended
exitAppTimeOut  = 0 			; min 	- Idle time after suspension before EPKL is shut down
startSuspended  = no

;;  After some inactivity, EPKL will try to release any modifiers that are stuck (with advanced usage this can happen)
cleanupTimeOut  = 3 			; s 	- Idle time in seconds before EPKL cleans up any stuck modifiers etc

;;  The EPKL Help Image Generator can use Inkscape to create a set of help images from the current layout
