DreymaR's Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks - EPKL
===========================================
  
Other files info
----------------
In this folder are some files that aren't used by EPKL but may still be interesting.
  
- The Key code table is a list of keys and their various names. See the Remap file for what EPKL uses.
- There's a .reg file, that's from RegEdit and may be used to change the Windows Registry. Do this only with great care!
	- The one in this directory may be used to set what "App1" and "App2" refers to, for the Extend1 layer.
	- There are other .reg files that remap keys. These do so at the lowest level possible which will work everywhere.
- There's a .klc file, that's from the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC). With it you can make installable layouts.
	- You'll need to install MSKLC from Microsoft's site. With it you can look at existing Win layouts and make new ones.
	- The original PKL was able to import .klc files to layout.ini files; in the future EPKL may also do that.
