;;  To use this layout, edit the EPKL_Layouts.ini 'layout = ' and/or Type/Mod/ID/etc entries.
;;  Alternatively, run EPKL in compactMode with the layout's files in the main program folder.
;
;;  This is an EPKL style layout.ini file
;;    - It may point to a base layout, Extend and DeadKey table files containing layout parts
;;    - The layout file specifies changes from the base layout, remaps and other layout info
;;    - A classic PKL layout.ini file can be reconstructed from the component files
;;    - If the layout file uses remaps, those must be redone manually for full reconstruction

;;  README for Colemak-eD-Vi-ANSI
;;  =============================
;;  
;;  This layout aims to provide a Vietnamese Colemak that works well with EPKL and Colemak[eD].
;;  * Special letters are on AltGr(RAlt) plus letters D A W E O I U → đ â ă ê ô ơ ư
;;  * Accents ´`?~. are on bracket keys as well as AltGr plus R S T.
;;  * This layout was designed to work with a standard US-type ANSI system (Windows) layout with RAlt key not defined as AltGr.
;;  * This type of system layout is typical for US and Vietnamese keyboards. This layout also works on ISO keyboards though!
;;  
;;  * To use, set the layout elements in EPKL_Settings.ini like this:
;;      ``kbdType/CurlMod/ErgoMod/LocalID = ANS / -- / -- / Vi``
;;  * Then (re)run or refresh EPKL and it should work.
;;  * Check out which ergo mods are available in the Layouts folder. You may set others in the layout.ini file.
;;  * Help images are pre-generated for each setup. Thus, if you change mods you'll have to generate new images or live with it.
