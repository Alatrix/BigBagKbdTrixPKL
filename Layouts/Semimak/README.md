The Semimak layout
------------------
- This layout was made by Semilin alias Semi based on novel analysis techniques.
- For more info, see [the Semimak page on github.io][SemGit]
- This layout spoke to me! It said: "Y havz Q-Wulf? I not, k? CDers b M-JPG. X"
    - This reads: Why have the Q-Wulf? I don't, okay? CD-ers be M-JPG. Kiss!
    - I have no idea what the Q-Wulf is, nor why they wouldn't prefer MPEG...
- For Semimak-eD, I moved the `‹›‚‘’` quotes so they're more logically placed.
- The `<≤` and `>≥` mappings were swapped, so their positional relation remains.

#### Semimak vanilla:
```
+----------------------------+
| y h a v z   q w u l f  [ ] |
| i n o t k   c d e r s  ; \ |
| / b . m j   p g , ' x      |
+----------------------------+
I'd add a Sym mod to the brackets-equals-hyphen keys.
```

#### Semimak AngleWide-ANSI as suggested by Semi:
```
+----------------------------+
| y h a v z  [  q w u l f  x |
| i n o t k  ]  c d e r s  \ |
|  b . m j  / ;  p g , '     |
+----------------------------+
```
