_The MTGAP layout with the [Angle and Sym ergonomic mods][BB_Erg] on an ISO board_

The MTGAP layout
----------------

- It's a more radical layout than Colemak, changing everything around â€“ even shift layers.
- With EPKL, it can be used with the usual Angle and Sym ergonomic mods added, as seen above.
