;;  This file provides named string literals callable by layouts with the &<PS> syntax
;;  It usually goes in the ./Files folder and is used by EPKL.exe
;
;;  - SendInput is not fast for long strings. Meanwhile, any released modifiers get stuck!
;;  - To prevent stuck modifiers, strings can be sent by the Windows SendMessage method.
;;  - For multiline strings, Message performed about twice as fast as Input for me.
;;  - For short strings SendMessage may be slower than SendInput, but it's robust.
;;  - The Paste method pastes the string via the clipboard. May not be reliable in all apps.
;;  - Paste seems best for block sending (n or rn): Fast, if the app gets line breaks right.
;;  - Message sending with +Enter line parsing works in most contexts but it's slower.
;;  
;;  PowerString syntax:
;;  - Any name may be used for &<name>. In layouts, I use short names for aesthetic reasons.
;;  - Multiline strings are used as illustrated below
;;  	- The string entry is set to <PS> = <Multiline> ##, where ## is the number of lines
;;  	- There should also be ## (00-99) numbered lines named <PS>-##
;;  	- End-of-line comments (<whitespace>;<comment>) are not stripped for these lines
;;  - Use optionally quoted strings to preserve white space
;;  - Prefix-entry syntax is allowed for single-line strings - see, e.g., _eD_Extend.ini
;;  - Use [\r \n \t \b \\] escapes for [`r `n `t `b \]
;;  - \n is line break, but some apps require \r\n. Can set the line break mode w/ brkMode.
;;  - There may be a system limit of about 5000 characters per string? I haven't tested.

;;  Line break mode: Send as `n, send as `r`n, or split lines and send Shift+Enter between.
brkMode = +Enter		; +Enter, n, rn
;;  String send mode: SendMessage calls, Clipboard Paste or SendInput {Raw}.
strMode = Message		; Message, Paste, Input, Text [AHK v1.1.30+]

;;  PowerStrings can be used as abbreviations to allow compact layout entries:
Spc     = β{Space} 			; Any 'Spc' or '={Space}' state entries are hardcoded so they can release DeadKeys etc. This one doesn't.
